TODO List for App::dupfind

Not necessarily listed in order of priority:

1)  DONE: Create a CPAN distribution from the working codebase for "dupfind"

2)  Reduce memory footprint

3)  Add more digest algorithm options

4)  Add more weed algorithm options, hopefully with at least 1 faster option
    than the current performance leader ("first_middle_last")

5)  Make a more flexible way of deleting duplicates

6)  Make an option to not ignore hardlinks
