0.140200-TRIAL 2014-01-20
 - App::dupfind is CPAN-ready, at least as a TRIAL dist.  It now contains
   a decent test suite in addition to its script.  The documentation may
   need more finishing touches, but is quite extensive as is.

0.000001 2014-01-17
 - App::dupfind is born from from Tommy Butler's "dupfind" codebase, a
   tuned, enhanced, and extended version of the baseline reference code
   for the DFW.pm (Dallas/Fort Worth) Perl Mongers Winter 2013 Hackathon
